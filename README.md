# PR280Ass-1

Create a Single Page Application (SPA) using Vuejs and JavaScript ES2018 that meets the requirements of the problem set.

Marking schedule
1. A plan for the work for each task (please refer to Appendix THREE) must include:
  a) The goal of each iteration.
  b) The planned tasks in sequence [planning, analysis, design, coding, testing]
  c) A time estimate for each task [10 minute blocks], i.e., which date, when, to do what
  d) A record of the actual time each task took, i.e., time log (Use tool: https://www.toggl.com/) (10 marks)
2. A design level class diagram for each iteration. (10 marks)
3. A plan for how the program feature of an iteration you are working on will work. By the end of this assignment use at least five of the following design techniques:
    * UML dynamic diagram (activity, collaboration, state transition, sequence)
    * Use case
    * storyboard
    * Wireframe with tag types, classes/names/ids, attributes, and associated CSS values
    * Pseudocode
    * ‘Planning A Complex Algorithm’ worksheet*Spike solution1.
    (10 marks)
4. Fill in test planning section of the test report in plain English for all functions required. (10 marks)
5. Working programs with all required features and proof of they pass StandardJS validation (30 marks)
6. Run the test to fill in the actual result section in the testing report (10 marks)
7. At least 5 Error logs each recording at least 5 errors (10 marks)
8. At least 5 Process Improvement Proposals (10 marks)

## Problem Set:

1. Input a series of letters. End with a "rogue" of a full stop. Output the number of g’s entered (there may not be any).
2. Input a "target" letter, followed by a series of letters. End with a "rogue" of a full stop. Output the number of times the target letter was entered in the series.
3. Input a series of numbers. End with a "rogue" of 999. Output the number of positive numbers in the series. Output the number of negative numbers in the series. Output the number of zeros in the series.
4. Input a series of integers. End with a “rogue” of 999. Output the number of times the “next” integer is twice the previous.
5. Input a series of integers. End with a “rogue” of 999. Output the message “Series in sequence” if the series is in ascending order or the message “Series not in sequence” if the series isn’t. Note that if adjacent values are equal, the series is still in ascending order.
